# Model Analysis

This directory contains things related to model analysis. Right now, this just includes:
1. CSVs containing per-(verb,polarity,tense) WAIC estimates for the contentful and templatic validation data for both belief and desire inferences (`{belief,desire}/*.waic.csv`)
2. CSVs containing per-(verb,polarity,tense) estimates of WAIC *differences* between random slopes and random intercepts models on this same data (`{belief,desire}/*.comparison.csv`)
Data from further analyses, such as those focused on the posteriors for specific parameters, may be added later.
